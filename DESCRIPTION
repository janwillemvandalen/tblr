Description: 
    Simple but hopefully helpful tool to create three types of basic tables commonly used in data reporting
    The tbls command allows for the creation of tables reporting the number valid values with the mean and standard deviation
    the median with inter quartile range or the proportion in % with 95% confidence interval of that estimate.
    The tblr command allows for the creation of N by 2 tables, reporting the same information in 2 separate groups and comparing
    the values for statistically significant difference using Student's T-tests for means, Mann-Whitney U-tests for medians and
    Fisher's exact tests for proprtions.
    The tbles command allows for the creation of tables reporting the results of Cox, linear or logistic regression analyses
    conducted using coxme, coxph, glmer, glm, lmer and lm functions. Reported are the number of events/total number, the estimate,
    the 95% confidence interval and the p-value.
